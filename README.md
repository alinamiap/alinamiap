- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm @alinamiap, a dedicated computer science student at the University of Houston - Downtown ðŸŽ“. While I might be new to the coding scene, I'm fueled by a passion for learning and a strong desire to master the art of problem-solving.
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development, animation, robotics, web development, and really anything I can get my hands on!
  
- ðŸŒ± Currently, my journey in the world of computer science is focused on honing my skills through rigorous practice on LeetCode or a personal project that I can not wait to announce (once I can get it all together!). With each problem I tackle, I'm not just seeking solutions; I'm building a foundation of knowledge and problem-solving strategies that will serve me well as I grow in this exciting field.
  
- ðŸ“š When I'm not immersed in coding practice, you might find me tending to my plants, at the dog park, experimenting with small coding projects, or engaging in video games with friends. My current addiction is Baldur's Gate 3 (great job Larian Studios!)
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn is the best way to contact me, unless my hands are full you should receive a speedy response!

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, can't wait to connect!
