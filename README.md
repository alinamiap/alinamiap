Greetings! I'm @alinamiap, a dedicated computer science student at the University of Houston - Downtown. I’m interested in game development, animation, robotics, web development, and really anything I can get my hands on! When I'm not immersed in coding practice, you might find me tending to my plants, at the dog park, or gaming with friends.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, can't wait to connect!
